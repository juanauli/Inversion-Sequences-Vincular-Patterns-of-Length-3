Description: The program counts and finds inversion sequences avoiding
vincular (generalized) nonconsecutive and nonclassical patterns of length 3.

Instructions: The main functions are in the capitalized files. The remaining
files are auxiliary functions, with the exception of test_gen3.py and results.txt. The file test_gen3.py runs examples of all the main functions. The file results.txt contains the result of computations in test_gen3.py for the first few values.    

Built with: Python 2.7.12
